ATLAS Devkit Unofficial Patch v1.0
created by The Rare Aquatic Pyro
====================================================================

An unofficial patch that contains edits to devkit base files to fix loading errors and issues that Grapeshot did not fix before abandoning the game, and hopefully continue to let users work on mods without crashing on cooks or loading.

Installation:
- Copy the Content folder to <Your devkit install directory>\AtlasModKit\Projects\ShooterGame and merge it with the Content folder that exists there
- When asked about replacing files, select Yes to all and wait for files to be overwritten
- Launch the devkit and pray that it works better.

Removal:
- Validate the devkit files with the Epic Games launcher, this should revert all changes from the patch to the base devkit files provided by Epic
